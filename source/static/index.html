        <h3>This is an api not a web page, so it has only methods as described below:</h3>
        <ul class="list">
            <li> <span>get-phrase-hash</span>
            takes a single argument which will be treated as a string, then it returns a JSON with folowing structure
            <span>{"phrase": "","HashedPhrase": ""}</span>, where phrase is the object you passed to the method and the HashedPhrase is sha256
            from the "phrase" trimed and converted to int64 type
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>get-detailed-hash</span>
            Same as previous but response JSON includes additional fields, such as <span>"HexedPhrase":"","HexedCuttedPhrase":""</span>
            where HexedPhrase is sha256 sum in hex format, and HexedCuttedPhrase is trimmed HexedPhrase to fit int64
            </li>
        </ul>
